# GMTK-jam-2019-Full-Press
My entry for the 2019 Game Maker's Toolkit Game Jam, the theme was 'Only One'

I based my game around the idea of half presses and full presses in speedrunning.
You can only press each key once per level, so you need to carefully consider when you press, hold, and release them.
